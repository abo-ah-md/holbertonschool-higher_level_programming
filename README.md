## Introduction

This repository contains a wide range of programming projects designed for Holberton School’s higher-level programming curriculum. Projects span Python, JavaScript, SQL, and more. These exercises help develop practical skills in algorithms, data structures, OOP, database management, web development, and API creation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders according to topic or project focus. Each folder contains code files and a detailed `README.md` that explains the goals, usage, and implementation details for that specific topic.
