# Python Data Structures

This directory contains solutions for the **Holberton School "Python Data Structures" project**, covering fundamental Python list, tuple, and sequence operations. The scripts demonstrate essential techniques with practical examples, meeting all project requirements and coding standards.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- **Explain lists:** what they are and how to use them
- **Compare strings and lists:** similarities and differences
- **Use common list methods** effectively
- **Utilize lists as stacks and queues**
- **Write and understand list comprehensions**
- **Understand tuples:** creation, use cases, and differences vs. lists
- **Recognize and work with sequences** in Python
- **Tuple packing and unpacking:** what they mean and how to use them
- **Use the `del` statement** for removing items

---

## Requirements

- **All scripts:** must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Editors allowed:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Python version:** 3.8.5 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- **pycodestyle compliance:** version 2.7.*
- **Executable files:** all scripts must have execution permission
- **End-of-file:** each file must end with a new line
- **File length:** will be checked using `wc`
- **README.md** at the project root (this file)

## Example Usage

### Print List of Integers

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
print_list_integer = import('0-print_list_integer').print_list_integer

my_list =â€‹
print_list_integer(my_list)
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
