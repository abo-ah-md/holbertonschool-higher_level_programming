## Project Overview

This directory contains the foundational Python scripts for Holberton's Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
You’ll learn that Python often provides multiple ways to solve the same problem, although exercises here may require one solution type.

## Concepts

- [Python programming](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/896)

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain (to anyone) without Google:
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings, as well as indexing and slicing
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

---

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts**
    - Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    - Only Python3 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, version 3.8.*)
    - All files end with a new line
    - First line must be: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
    - Two README files required: one at the repo root, one here
    - Code style: pycodestyle 2.7.*
    - All files must be executable
    - File length checked using `wc`
    - *Note:* Pycodestyle is stricter than PEP8. Holberton uses PEP8 warnings as informational only.

| 3 | 5-print_string.py                       | Print string 3 times; then its first 9 characters, no loops                              | 6      |
| 4 | 6-concat.py                             | Concatenate two strings to form: `"Welcome to Holberton School!"`, no loops              | 9      |
| 5 | 7-edges.py                              | Extract first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and middle part of word, no loops               | 9      |
| 6 | 8-concat_edges.py                       | Form `"object-oriented programming with Python"` using slicing, no new variables         | 9      |
| 7 | 9-easter_egg.py                         | Print “The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters” in 98 characters                                | 9      |

## Usage

- Each script is executable:
    ```
    ./2-print.py
    ./3-print_number.py
    ./4-print_float.py
    ./5-print_string.py
    ./6-concat.py
    ./7-edges.py
    ./8-concat_edges.py
    ./9-easter_egg.py
    ```
- Check scripts with pycodestyle:
    ```
    pycodestyle <filename>
    ```

## Author’s Disclaimer

With Python (and most higher-level languages), there are many ways to solve problems.  
Holberton encourages single-solution approaches in this project, though style compliance matters!

Enjoy experimenting—warnings from PEP8 can be ignored for now.
